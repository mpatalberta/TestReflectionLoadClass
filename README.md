TestReflectionLoadClass
=======================

Test the reflection amd load a jar dynamically and use the class inside

The purpose is to load a jar file and then access the memnber set and get function along with constructors.
You must TestReflection2 have compiled the TestReflection2 and create a jar file that is used in this example.
The two projects are somewhat connected.

The class jar loader.

The class class loader does not. I consitently get a class not found. Once I get the fix I will update.
